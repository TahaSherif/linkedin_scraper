Used mathematical concepts of Real Analysis, Bayesian probability analysis, Markov models, non-linear and linear optimization methods, and parameter estimation to design resource allocation algorithms in a variety of network, e.g. P2P, cellular downlink, MIMO and large-scale wireless networks. These resources are wireless physical-layer resources such as bandwidth, power, code rate, and users (in a multi-user system).

Proposed ACK/NAK based resource allocation schemes that only look at past 1-bit ACK/NAKs data to train the parameters of the algorithm (supervised model based learning) and then predict the best resources parameters to use in future. I showed that ACK/NAK based resource allocation schemes using continuous state wireless channels perform better than discrete-state wireless channels and can be made practical for use.

Proposed distributed resource allocation schemes for large-scale wireless networks. Analyzed and proposed 4 fundamental design principles that network providers (At&t/Verizon/T-mobile) have to employ to guarantee Quality-of-Service assurances to the customers while increasing the capacity of their network and maintaining their run-time costs and financial goals.
